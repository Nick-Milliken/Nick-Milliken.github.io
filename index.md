- A list of Tableau projects from coursework and group projects. Trying out different chart types and filters to see what makes a good visualization or not. Learning from my mistakes and successful attempts. <br><br>

- Problem: Building a Database for The Art of Life Academy LLC to better account for churn rate and student management in supplement to the current software in use. 

- Findings: Building the database was successful, there were some issues with the ER diagram and connecting everything to allow for effective and fruitful queries. We were able to solve this in a team meeting and mapping everything out in real time with the whole team. Some variable names and connections had to be adjusted/fixed doing this during COVID made meetings difficult but we were able to overcome with Slack and Zoom.  

- Decisions: The Art of Life ultimately decided to continue to use their current software and use our database on a case by case, as needed instance.

- Problem:  Building a model that will help predict the expected time of products to the wharehouse as early or late. The goal is to find ways to reduce the early/late costs of holding onto inventory. 
<br><br>
- Findings: I was able to use features that produced results from the ML model to identify manufacturers that had the best on-time delivery rate and the ones that had the worst on-time delivery rate. 
<br><br>
- Results: Recommendations were given on what features and companies should be further evaluated to identify how to replicate qualities from the best manufacturer delivery rates in the worst manufacturer delivery rates and vice versa. Our preliminary results estimated an average savings of $230/order/manufacturer were possible.

<br><br> 
- Problem: Are there features from the data that can accurately predict if the value of a house will go up or down? 

- Model: We were able to create a model that utilized the different features from the data to identify a change in valuation. 

- Result: Most of the features did not return significant results and were unreliable. There were a couple of features that produced well enough to prove proof of concept but further work needs to be done. An ML model with training and test data would be preferred. Please utilize the link to look at the code.

<br><br>
- Problem: Client wanted a Master Table or Dashboard to track employee tasks. Furthermore, the client wanted a sheet for each employee that would be populated with their specific tasks as well as a table of tasks completed within the last week. 

- Solution: Created a Master Table with all employee's and tasks. There was no data given so five dummies were created. A sheet for each of the five dummies was created with the requested information. Macros were utilized to filter data on date and auto-updates enabled. As a back up short cut keys were created to update employee sheets from the Master Table.
